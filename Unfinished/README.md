# Unfinished Projects

### Overview
These bots currently have little or no functionality at the moment, and will be implemented to a state consistent with my active projects at a later time. Feel free to look at the existing source code for inspiration.

### WIP Projects
```GnuWolf```: A bot designed to help with mathematical operations, especially for programming. Ideally, it will access the WolframAlpha API for complex calculations.<br />
```Bad Alexa```: A simple music player that can play the audio from Youtube videos. Ideally will have a queue system for loading audio and possibly API access for other audio services like Spotify.
