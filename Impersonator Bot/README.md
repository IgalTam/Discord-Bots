# Impersonator Bot

### Overview
This bot was originally designed to emulate the behavior of the Hunter Bot, but with different audio. However, the design has been expanded upon to enable the impersonation of a target user. The bot takes on the nickname, profile picture, and activity of the target. Additionally, it can be set to appear offline or online and can join/leave a voice channel of the user's choice. The bot can also retrieve the image file for a user or guild, and can be remotely operated like the Hunter Bot.
