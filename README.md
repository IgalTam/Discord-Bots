# Discord-Bots
Github containing my various Discord bot programs. Python-based scripts developed using the discord.py API.

##### To use the bot code for yourself, do one of the following:
1) On the line in the main bot files that initializes the bot token, replace the macro with the token for your application.
2) In the directories of the bots you want to use, create a file called config.py and include a macro that matches the one in the main file (I recommmend this one for more secureness). 
  For instance, to use the Hunter Bot, in the directory "Hunter Bot"/, create a file "Hunter Bot"/config.py that contains the line `HUNTER = <your application token string>`.
