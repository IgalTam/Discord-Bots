# Bad Grouper

### Overview
This bot is designed to automate server tasks involving tedious administrative actions. This includes creating multiple channels at once, removing multiple channels at once, and assigning a role to multiple members at once. Additionally, the ```gmaker``` and ```rmaker``` Cogs allow for the archiving and cloning of guild channels and roles.

### Special Notes
1) For guild safety, all commands require adminstrator permissions to use.
2) ```mult```: This is a complex but flexible UNIX-style command that can perform multiple operations simultaneously. Due to the variable quantity of parameters that can be inputted to the command, it is not supported by slash commands. As such, it must be run with the command prefix ```/*/```. See the command ```mult_help``` for more information on using ```mult```.
