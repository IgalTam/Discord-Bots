# Hunter Bot

### Overview
This is a prank bot designed for jumpscaring voice channel users by playing the Hunter pouncing audio from Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 (audio found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ogxxcSZhM)). On request, the bot enters a specified voice channel, plays audio, then leaves the channel. A WIP feature is the ability to schedule a random time for the Hunter bot to "attack" a voice channel. Additionally, the Hunter Bot is compatible with the Hunter Bot MkII, providing a command to temporarily disable welcome messages on a server and automatically deleting all instances of messages mentioning the MkII. The Hunter Bot supports remote operation and can be activated from another guild.

### Special Notes
1) For guild safety and mitigating irresponsive actions, ```dw``` requires adminstrator permissions to use.
